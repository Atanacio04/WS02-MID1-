    <h2>Power & Abilities</h2>
    <p>Cid is described as possibly 'the most powerful being in the world,' be it martial arts or magic, to the point of it being doubted whether he is even human. In fact, he is actually the strongest in several worlds, defeating a demon from another dimension without much difficulty. Despite having yet to demonstrate his full strength, all of Cid's battles so far have ended in overwhelming victories, easily defeating high-ranking Cult of Diablos and Knights of Rounds members, with the only opponents he had to get a "little serious" against being the Mist Dragon, Aurora's projection, Beatrix, Elisabeth, and the aforementioned demon.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the development and training of his previous life in Martial Arts, plus the Arts of Fencing, his experience, and what he reproduced and repeated in the other world, plus his study and acquisition with magic, Cid developed a capacity very strong, to be able to read, study, understand, among other things, the movements of his opponents, whether they attack him, or something else</p>
        <li>Master Swordsmanship</li>
        <p>Before reincarnating, Minoru displayed a desire to become an 'Eminence in the Shadow' and began practicing various fencing starting from his childhood and spanning his teenage years until he reincarnated.</p>

        <li>Warrior Perception</li>
        <p>Cid developed a type of Sensation, which is more than a skill, which is only achieved by the strongest elite warriors and those who have fully mastered the handling of the sword and direct combat, called the "warrior sense".</p>
